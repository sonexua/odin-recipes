        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pasta e fagioli, or just pasta fagioli. I knew—and loved—this dish years before I knew how to spell it. Growing up in New Jersey, pasta e fagioli is a 
            staple on every red sauce place's menu, along with spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, alfredo and cannolis. </p>
        
        <p>Pasta fagioli, aka pasta fazool (which is Neapolitan dialect for the standard Italian word for "beans"), is a peasant dish, a simple soup of pasta and beans 
            and veggies. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion </li>
            <li>1 large carrot, peeled and chopped </li>
            <li>1 large celery stalk, chopped </li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced </li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon chili flakes </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Sauté the vegetables. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, carrot and celery for 2 to 3 minutes, until its soft and translucent. Add the garlic, chili flakes and Italian seasoning and sauté another minute. </li>
            <li> Add stock, tomatoes, pasta. Add the chicken stock and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Add the pasta and keep the soup at a strong simmer. </li>
            <li> Add beans, parsley. When the pasta is al dente, add the beans and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the parsley. Add salt and black pepper to taste. </li>
        </ol>
